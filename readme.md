------------------
>  Note: To display a new background image and a `marquee` quote at the top of the new tab page free apis are used 

1. Image api for a new background image when new tab is opened 
2. Quote api at the top of new tab page

[there might be a delay in getting a new image or quote based on the internet speed. Addressing of this issue is a WIP]
